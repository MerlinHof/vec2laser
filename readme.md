## Welcome to Vec2Laser

Vec2Laser is a web based front to back laser control software for GRBL laser engravers and cutters. Its backend uses python and php and can be installed on a Raspberry Pi connected to the USB-Port of the laser to even enable wireless control. Or it can all be installed on your laptop to have a complete experience.

### Note

This project is currently in an early **alpha state**. This note will be _removed_, once the software works reliably.

### Motivation

Most of the available software for this job is either outdated, paid, Windows-only or extremely unitinutive and hard to use. That's why I made this software to have a smooth and enjoyable experience using your laser.

### Installation

To use this software, you need to install python3 and the python package `pyserial`. Then simply run the `server.py` in the backend folder and voil√°.
