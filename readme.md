## Welcome to Vec2Laser

Vec2Laser is a powerful web based laser control software for GRBL laser engravers and cutters.

### Note

This project is currently in an early **alpha state**. This note will be _removed_, once the software works reliably and safely.

### Motivation

Most of the available software for this job is either outdated, paid, Windows-only or extremely unitinutive and hard to use. That's why I made this software to have a smooth and enjoyable experience using your laser.

### Installation

To use this software, you need to have a working installation of Python3 and the Python package `pyserial`. Then simply run the `server.py` in the backend folder and voil√°.
(Detailed instructions coming soon)
